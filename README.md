For scraping tweets from hashtags: tweets_GOT_Finale_scraping.ipynb 

Sentiment anaisys of GOT tweets is available here: tweets_analisys_GOT_Final_GGC_version.ipynb
I've fixed a little bit the code. 

After that I've used fastText library to clean tweets before analisys to compare with the initial version. Cleaning tweets improved sentiment analisys so that more tweets 'survived' removal of tweets with 0,0 sentiment: tweets_analisys_GOT_Final_fastText.ipynb

Here is the scraped data, so we can use the same one for further tasks: GOT_tweets_raw
